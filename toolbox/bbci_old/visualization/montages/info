# This folder contains definitions for different channel montages specifying 3D
# coordinates in a normalized coordinate system (x,y,z). All coordinates range
# from -1 to 1, where x gives the medial-lateral direction (right hemisphere
# positive), y gives the anterior-posterior direction (anterior/front positive),
# and z gives the inferior/superior direction (superior positive). Center of the
# coordinate system is the center of the spherical head model with normalized
# radius 1.
# In bbci/acquisition/documents/montages/ PDFs for the respective montages
# can be found.
# Data is organized in four columns:
# channel x y z
