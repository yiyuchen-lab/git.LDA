function [y_Out]= apply_libsvm(model, dat, varargin)
% APPLY_LIBSVM - wrapper for applying an SVM model (classification or regression) via libsvm.
%
%Synopsis:
%   C = apply_libsvm(MODEL, DAT, <OPT>)
%
%Arguments:
%   MODEL: [STRUCT] - SVM model, that has been trained via train_libsvm (a classifier, regressor or distribution estimator).
%   DAT: DOUBLE [NxM] - Data matrix, with N feature dimensions, and M test points/examples.
%   OPT: PROPLIST - Structure or property/value list of optional properties:
%     'b' - BOOL (default 0): probability_estimates - whether to train a SVC or SVR model for probability estimates
%     'q' - BOOL: if provided, quiet mode (no outputs).  Omit q completely to activate outputs (opt.b==0 is not working).
%
%Returns:
%   Y_OUT: INT/DOUBLE [CxM] - Estimated class labels / class label probabilities /
%                             regression values for the example points contained in DAT.
%                             C is number of classes and M the number of test points/examples.
%                  The data type depends on the kind of SVM, number of classes and values of opt.b in training and application:
%                      - epsilon-SVR and nu-SVR: estimated regression values (numeric, DOUBLE)
%                      - 2-class C-SVC, 2-class nu-SVC, one-class SVM:
%                        estimated signed distance to decision hyperplane
%                        (DOUBLE), with negative values for the first, and
%                        positive for the second class.
%                        If OPT.B==1, the class probabilities are given (DOUBLE).
%                      - n-class SVC (nu-type or C-type): estimated class labels (INT) in BBCI label format:
%                        Y_OUT(i,j)==1 if the point j belongs to class i.
%                        With option OPT.B==1 the class probabilities are
%                        returned instead (DOUBLE)
%
%Description:
%   APPLY_LIBSVM is a wrapper function for the BBCI toolbox to apply
%   a trained SVM classifier (one-, two-, or multiclass) or regression model
%   via the libsvm matlab interface to new data.
%
%   Multi-class SVM is realized by 1-vs-rest. If decision values are delivered (opt.b==0),
%   the interface of libsvm.
%   returns numeric values also for multi-class cases, but their interpretation is
%   unclear. For opt.b==1, the probability values are OK, but need
%   re-ordering according to model.Label
%
%   Prior to use with the bbci toolbox, the libsvm package needs to be
%   downloaded and the matlab interface needs to be compiled (mex).
%
%   More details about this model can be found in the LIBSVM FAQ:
%   (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html)
%   and the LIBSVM implementation document:
%   (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/libsvm.pdf).

    fld = Fld{1};

%% Actual application of the model to data
[y_PredClassLabels, acc, y_PredVals] = svmpredict(libsvm_labels, dat', model, libsvm_opts);
% The function 'svmpredict' has three outputs. The first one,
% y_PredClassLabels, is a vector of predicted labels. The second output,
% acc, is a vector including accuracy (for classification), mean
% squared error, and squared correlation coefficient (for regression).
% The third (y_PredVals) is a matrix containing decision values or probability
% estimates (if '-b 1' is specified). If k is the number of classes
% in training data, for decision values, each row includes results of
% predicting k(k-1)/2 binary-class SVMs. For classification, k = 1 is a
% special case. Decision value +1 is returned for each testing instance,
% instead of an empty vector. For probabilities, each row contains k values
% indicating the probability that the testing instance is in each class.
% 
% For b==0 and b==1: Note that the order of classes here is the same as 'Label' field
% in the model structure.
%
% (MT:) Strange enough, libsvm allows for providing labels for the data, such
% that an accuracy can be calculated. I ignored it, as
% e.g. the BBCI xvalidation routine can also take care of this.
